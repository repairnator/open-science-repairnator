- **Human Patch**: The pull request has been closed without merging it into the upstream branch. In this case, the human patch can be seen as the fact that the developer deleted the piece of code introduced with the [pull request](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/pull/1076).
- **Overview**: The problem is related to the method [`internalConvert`](https://github.com/repairnator/repairnator-experiments/blob/fdb7d8ebacdbc51622252eb40fa85722d2cc375d/pac4j-core/src/main/java/org/pac4j/core/profile/converter/StringConverter.java#L16), which override has been done in the failing commit. This commit belongs to a [pull request](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/pull/1076) that has not been accepted. Indeed, removing the override of this method, the program passes all the test cases.
- **Reason why the patch has been generated**: jKali managed to create a patch because it removes [this `return` statement](https://github.com/repairnator/repairnator-experiments/blob/fdb7d8ebacdbc51622252eb40fa85722d2cc375d/pac4j-core/src/main/java/org/pac4j/core/profile/converter/StringConverter.java#L18) in the method `internalConvert`, and so the method returns `null` as the test case expects. This is the correct behaviour. Indeed, removing this return statement, the method returns `null` as the superclass `AbstractAttributeConverter` [method](https://github.com/repairnator/repairnator-experiments/blob/fdb7d8ebacdbc51622252eb40fa85722d2cc375d/pac4j-core/src/main/java/org/pac4j/core/profile/converter/AbstractAttributeConverter.java#L44) does.
- **Useful information for the developer**: The code-removal patch changes the piece of code added in the commit that changed the status of build from `passed` to `failed`. This means that the patch allows the developer to focus direclty on the new piece of code to understand which is the error. In this specific case, the change has not been accepted, so it is correct to remove the functionality.
