# R-Hero - Builds & Patches Analysis

## Content

This directory contains data about failing Travis CI builds for which SequenceR managed to generate a patch. In particular, `builds` folder has a subfolder for every build analyzed, and it contains the following data:

- A JSON file named with the build id obtained using the Travis CI API for every Travis CI build failure;
- The `jobs` folder that contains a subfolder for every build and each of them contains as many JSON files (obtained using the Travis CI API) as the number of jobs associated with that build;
- The `sequence-repair-patches` folder that contains the patches generated by SequenceR;
- A JSON file called `developer-fix.patch` that contains the developer fix (when it is available).

For each of these failing builds, there is a specific branch containing the source code that made the build fail.
